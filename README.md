# Flappy Bird

## About the project

Flappy Bird is my implementation of the game of the same name using Swift and the SpriteKit framework. The project was created for educational purposes to learn iOS game development.

## Features

* Visualization: The project includes unique graphic assets created with the design of the original game in mind.
* Physics and Animations: Using the SpriteKit framework, I implemented realistic bird physics, flight and obstacle collision animations.
* Collision Handling: Implemented collision handling, including scoring when passing obstacles.
* Sound Effects: Added sound effects to enhance the game experience.

## Closing remarks

Flappy Bird Clone is not only a game, but also a productive experience in 2D game development for iOS. The project demonstrates my skills in SpriteKit, animations, sound effects, and collision control. Through this project, I have improved my understanding of creating interactive applications and am ready for new development challenges.
